# Wheeler-Graphs-DS202-Project
To execute the program, we need input sequence file 'input.txt' and run the following commands:
```
$ make
$ ./WH < input.txt
```
The program takes the input sequence and returns the linear wheeler graph. That is, in-degree-vector(I), out-degree-vector(O), edge-label-array(L) and array C(frequency count). It also outputs the time taken to buils the WH for a given sequence.
